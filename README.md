- Pipeline systems deteriorate progressively over time through various means.
- This product aims to create a pipeline inspection robot that has an adaptable structure to the pipe diameter, and cheap at the same time.
- Pipeline inspection robots are designed to act in inaccessible environment and also to remove the human factor from labour intensive or dangerous work environments. 
- Our challenge is to make this robot adaptable to pipe diameters varying from 450mm to 700mm with an adjustable probe mount.
